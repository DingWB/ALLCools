    abstract = "Mammalian brain cells show remarkable diversity in gene
              expression, anatomy and function, yet the regulatory DNA
              landscape underlying this extensive heterogeneity is poorly
              understood. Here we carry out a comprehensive assessment of the
              epigenomes of mouse brain cell types by applying single-nucleus
              DNA methylation sequencing1,2 to profile 103,982 nuclei
              (including 95,815 neurons and 8,167 non-neuronal cells) from 45
              regions of the mouse cortex, hippocampus, striatum, pallidum and
              olfactory areas. We identified 161 cell clusters with distinct
              spatial locations and projection targets. We constructed
              taxonomies of these epigenetic types, annotated with signature
              genes, regulatory elements and transcription factors. These
              features indicate the potential regulatory landscape supporting
              the assignment of putative cell types and reveal repetitive usage
              of regulators in excitatory and inhibitory cells for determining
              subtypes. The DNA methylation landscape of excitatory neurons in
              the cortex and hippocampus varied continuously along spatial
              gradients. Using this deep dataset, we constructed an artificial
              neural network model that precisely predicts single neuron
              cell-type identity and brain area spatial location. Integration
              of high-resolution DNA methylomes with single-nucleus chromatin
              accessibility data3 enabled prediction of high-confidence
              enhancer-gene interactions for all identified cell types, which
              were subsequently validated by cell-type-specific chromatin
              conformation capture experiments4. By combining multi-omic
              datasets (DNA methylation, chromatin contacts, and open
              chromatin) from single nuclei and annotating the regulatory
              genome of hundreds of cell types in the mouse brain, our DNA
              methylation atlas establishes the epigenetic basis for neuronal
              diversity and spatial organization throughout the mouse cerebrum.",
