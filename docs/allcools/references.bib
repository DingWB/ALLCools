    abstract = "Mammalian brain cells show remarkable diversity in gene
              expression, anatomy and function, yet the regulatory DNA
              landscape underlying this extensive heterogeneity is poorly
              understood. Here we carry out a comprehensive assessment of the
              epigenomes of mouse brain cell types by applying single-nucleus
              DNA methylation sequencing1,2 to profile 103,982 nuclei
              (including 95,815 neurons and 8,167 non-neuronal cells) from 45
              regions of the mouse cortex, hippocampus, striatum, pallidum and
              olfactory areas. We identified 161 cell clusters with distinct
              spatial locations and projection targets. We constructed
              taxonomies of these epigenetic types, annotated with signature
              genes, regulatory elements and transcription factors. These
              features indicate the potential regulatory landscape supporting
              the assignment of putative cell types and reveal repetitive usage
              of regulators in excitatory and inhibitory cells for determining
              subtypes. The DNA methylation landscape of excitatory neurons in
              the cortex and hippocampus varied continuously along spatial
              gradients. Using this deep dataset, we constructed an artificial
              neural network model that precisely predicts single neuron
              cell-type identity and brain area spatial location. Integration
              of high-resolution DNA methylomes with single-nucleus chromatin
              accessibility data3 enabled prediction of high-confidence
              enhancer-gene interactions for all identified cell types, which
              were subsequently validated by cell-type-specific chromatin
              conformation capture experiments4. By combining multi-omic
              datasets (DNA methylation, chromatin contacts, and open
              chromatin) from single nuclei and annotating the regulatory
              genome of hundreds of cell types in the mouse brain, our DNA
              methylation atlas establishes the epigenetic basis for neuronal
              diversity and spatial organization throughout the mouse cerebrum.",

              but understanding of its spatiotemporal distribution in the
              developing embryo remains limited1,2. Here, as part of the mouse
              Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project, we profiled 168
              methylomes from 12 mouse tissues or organs at 9 developmental
              stages from embryogenesis to adulthood. We identified 1,808,810
              genomic regions that showed variations in CG methylation by
              comparing the methylomes of different tissues or organs from
              different developmental stages. These DNA elements predominantly
              lose CG methylation during fetal development, whereas the trend
              is reversed after birth. During late stages of fetal development,
              non-CG methylation accumulated within the bodies of key
              developmental transcription factor genes, coinciding with their
              transcriptional repression. Integration of genome-wide DNA
              methylation, histone modification and chromatin accessibility
              data enabled us to predict 461,141 putative developmental
              tissue-specific enhancers, the human orthologues of which were
              enriched for disease-associated genetic variants. These
              spatiotemporal epigenome maps provide a resource for studies of
              gene regulation during tissue or organ progression, and a
              starting point for investigating regulatory elements that are
              involved in human developmental disorders.",

              mechanisms that could have tissue-specific roles. Surveys of DNA
              methylation in human tissues have established a complex landscape
              including both tissue-specific and invariant methylation
              patterns. Here we report high coverage methylomes that catalogue
              cytosine methylation in all contexts for the major human organ
              systems, integrated with matched transcriptomes and genomic
              sequence. By combining these diverse data types with each
              individuals' phased genome, we identified widespread
              tissue-specific differential CG methylation (mCG), partially
              methylated domains, allele-specific methylation and
              transcription, and the unexpected presence of non-CG methylation
              (mCH) in almost all human tissues. mCH correlated with
              tissue-specific functions, and using this mark, we made novel
              predictions of genes that escape X-chromosome inactivation in
              specific tissues. Overall, DNA methylation in several genomic
              contexts varies substantially among human tissues.",
